<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><h3 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h3><p>Back when I first started, my yoga practice was a bit clumsy, but I never truly felt like starting from zero.
During my childhood, I always had a good relationship with sports.
I was part of the local <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apetenchea/cdroot/master/source/_posts/sivananda-yoga-teachers-training-course/media/rugby.jpg">junior rugby team</a>.
During the long summer vacations, I used to play sports every day with my friends. Our go-to place used to be the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apetenchea/cdroot/master/source/_posts/sivananda-yoga-teachers-training-course/media/basketball.jpg">basketball field</a>.
I really enjoyed playing team sports. As time passed, we all got into college, family life and work. It became harder and harder to synchronize
a group of people that would be willing to play sports together. That’s when I shifted my focus to individual sports,
where generally the only person you need to synchronize with is yourself. Gym was the obvious choice, but in a way it felt
superficial. The moves were repetitive and the environment was not inspiring. I am not saying
that going to the gym is bad. I still attend fitness classes and train in a gym regularly.
It’s just that, for me, this feels like a great complement to other sports, but it’s a means to an end, not my main focus.<br>When I tried yoga, I was finally able to find an activity that I could practice on my own, but still feel like
I am part of a community. It’s also something which allows me to better connect with myself.<br>I started by watching online videos. When my practice got “serious”, I attended yoga classes.
That progressed into taking private lessons. Fast-forward a few years later, and I have now enrolled into a
teacher’s training course. I am joining an ashram in Southern India, for a month-long intensive course.  </p>
<h3 id="Purpose-of-writing-this"><a href="#Purpose-of-writing-this" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of writing this"></a>Purpose of writing this</h3><p>I decided to document this experience, as I believe it will be a great way to reflect on my journey and share it
with others. This is not a guide on how to become a yoga teacher, nor advice on how to prepare for an intensive course.
Every person is different, and there’s plenty of approaches to yoga. I am just sharing my own experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make sure to only compare yourself to your past self.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Course"><a href="#Course" class="headerlink" title="Course"></a>Course</h3><p>The course is organized by the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://sivananda.org.in/gudur/">SIVANANDA YOGA VEDANTA TAPASWINI ASHRAM</a>, located in
Gudur, Andhra Pradesh. The dates are 17th Dec 2023 - 13th Jan 2024. I picked the ashram in Gudur because it had
specific dates that worked for me, taking into account my job and other commitments.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://sivananda.org/"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apetenchea/cdroot/master/source/_posts/sivananda-yoga-teachers-training-course/media/Sivananda_IndiaLogo.png" alt="Sivananda Logo"></a></p>
<p>I found out about this school from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/@SivanandaDhanwantariAshram">Neyyar Dam Sivananda</a> and
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/@SivanandaYogaCentreGurgaon">Sivananda Yoga Centre, Gurgaon</a> YouTube channels.
I was looking for a school with a traditional approach to yoga and their content resonated well with me.
There are plenty of Sivananda centers around the world, but I wanted one located in India, as I sought the opportunity
to experience the culture and the country.<br>The course I’m taking is a 200h Teachers’ Training Course (TTC), based on the ancient <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurukula">gurukula</a>
system of India where teacher and student live together in a traditional Ashram. Graduates receive an internationally
recognized certificate. The school is a member the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.yogaalliance.org/">Yoga Alliance</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Before"><a href="#Before" class="headerlink" title="Before"></a>Before</h2><h3 id="Preparation"><a href="#Preparation" class="headerlink" title="Preparation"></a>Preparation</h3><p>Generally, I believe the best way to prepare for something is to do it. So of course, I’ve been practicing yoga regularly
at home and in classes. To aid with the physical aspect of it, I’m doing some fitness training at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dpointstudio.ro/">D’ Point Studio</a>.
The classes are great and the instructors are very knowledgeable. Every week, I attend three private training sessions,
and aim for two group classes (one full body workout and a core workout). To get a glimpse of
what it looks like, check out their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/@dpointstudio">YouTube channel</a>.  </p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dpointstudio.ro/"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apetenchea/cdroot/master/source/_posts/sivananda-yoga-teachers-training-course/media/dpoint.png" alt="D&#39; Point Studio Logo"></a></p>
<hr>

<p><strong>Monday</strong><br>8:00 - 9:00 personal training (<abbr title="High Intensity Interval Training">HIIT</abbr>)<br>I find HIIT the hardest of my workouts. In the beginning, it was very difficult to keep up with the pace, but now I really
enjoy it. It is indeed a challenge to keep my breath steady during the most intense parts of the workout, and it has
helped me a lot in that regard. I believe doing this type of athletic training once a week is a good way to balance
out the more relaxed pace of yoga, as I like to experience this kind of exercise as well, from time to time.  </p>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong><br>Yoga, at home. I generally use this day to recuperate from the previous day’s workout.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong>
8:00 - 9:00 personal training (suspended training)<br>With yoga, you do a lot of pushing exercises, but not so many pulling ones, and on Wednesdays I try to balance that out.
It’s also a great way to build strength in your core and back muscles. Pull-ups are the main part of this workout. The
progress is generally slow, but steady, and you have to keep doing it regularly to maintain the results.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong><br>18:30 - 19:30 fitness class (Power Strength - full body workout)<br>This is where I get to sweat a lot. It’s a good way to build strength and stamina, while making sure that not muscle
group is left behind. Generally, my legs are most sore after this workout.</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong><br>8:00 - 9:00 personal training (workout)<br>A bit more random, depending on how I felt during the week and what me and my trainer decide to focus on. 
Usually, we try to fine-tune some of the exercises. If I feel there’s a muscle group that needs more attention, my trainer
would come up with suitable exercises to target that area. Or, if I don’t make it to the group class on Thursday, we might do a
leg workout.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong><br>11:15 - 12:00 fitness class (Core Strength - core workout)<br>I can’t stress enough the importance of core muscles in yoga, and in life in general. For me, the abs require the most
maintenance. I find it very easy to lose the results I’ve gained, if I don’t exercise regularly. Just to be clear,
by “results” I’m not referring to the visual aspect of it (eg. a 6-pack), but rather to the endurance and strength of the abdominal muscles.
This is a difficult class, but it comes with soo many benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong><br>Yoga, at home. By now, I’ve had plenty of fitness during the week, so I try not to overdo it.</p>
<hr>

<p>Looking at the above, it might seem like a lot, but I’ve been doing this for a while now, so my body is used to it.<br>Sometimes, I might skip a workout, if I feel like I could use some extra rest. However, I never skip my personal training
sessions. I find that having a personal trainer is a great way to keep myself accountable and show up. Needless
to say, in order to maintain this lifestyle, the sleeping schedule (and eating habits) have to be on point. I generally aim to be in
bed before 22:00.<br>You might be wondering where is the yoga in all of this. <strong>Well, I try to do yoga every day, but I don’t have a fixed schedule.</strong>
What kind of practice I do really depends on how I feel. Sometimes, I might do a full one-hour class, other times
I might just do a short meditation. There’s plenty of practices to choose from, but usually my main focus is on
hip-opening and balancing poses.</p>
<h3 id="Visa"><a href="#Visa" class="headerlink" title="Visa"></a>Visa</h3><p>I got my indian visa from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/">indianvisaonline.gov.in</a>. I heard there are some websites
out there which try to pose as the official one, so be careful.</p>
<h3 id="Schedule"><a href="#Schedule" class="headerlink" title="Schedule"></a>Schedule</h3><p>In the last couple of months before the course, I became serious about my preparation. I decided to record my daily
schedule, which I’ll share below. I tried to keep it as consistent as possible, but sometimes I had to make adjustments
to accommodate other commitments. Nevertheless, recording my schedule was a great way to keep myself on track. I’m
not saying that this is the best way to prepare for a yoga course. Bear in mind I had zero prior experience with yoga
courses, so I’m just sharing my own practice.</p>

<p>If there’s something I’ve learned from this, it’s that the power of consistency is immense. It’s not so much about the
particular practice you choose to do, but rather about showing up every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Reading"><a href="#Reading" class="headerlink" title="Reading"></a>Reading</h3><p>Before the course, I tried to learn a bit about the philosophy of yoga. One, a gentleman from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.iskcon.org/">ISKCOM</a>
handed me a copy of Bhagavad Gita, which I finally decided to put to good use. I’ve managed to read about half of it (including commentary)
before the course, which already gave me a good head-start. My suggestion is to go for a version that includes commentary, as it
helps a lot with understanding the meaning behing text.</p>
<h2 id="During"><a href="#During" class="headerlink" title="During"></a>During</h2><h3 id="Arrival"><a href="#Arrival" class="headerlink" title="Arrival"></a>Arrival</h3><p>I arrived in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, on 13<sup>th</sup> December 2023, 4 days before the course started. I wanted to give myself
some time to adjust to the weather and time zone. One of the first things I did was buy some local clothes. Not only are they
made of lighter materials, but they also help you blend in with the locals. It was really fun travelling around India
and not feeling like a tourist. Totally worth it. Needless to say, the city is pretty busy.    </p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apetenchea/cdroot/master/source/_posts/sivananda-yoga-teachers-training-course/media/chennai.jpg" alt="Chennai"></p>
<p>The people were just wonderful. The food was amazing. My favourite place was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://g.co/kgs/UYYPE1x">Geetha Cafe</a>,
a pure vegetarian restaurant located on Sir Thiyagaraya Road, T. Nagar. Their masala dosa is out of this world. I ate there
every day, and it will always be my go-to place when I visit Chennai.<br>Below is a picture of me wearing a Pathani Suit, together with one of my friends from Geetha Cafe.</p>

<p>On Saturday, I went to the train station and took the train to Gudur Junction. Because I could not use online booking,
due to the fact that I never received my confirmation SMS message (OPT), I had to buy the ticket at the station the day before, on Friday.
I managed to get a tatkal ticket on the Navjeevan SF Express, at a higher price, but it was still cheaper than a taxi.
If you find yourself in a similar situation where you can’t book a ticket online, I suggest you go to the station at least a day before
and ask for help at the counter. They will guide you through the process. The train ride itself took about 2 hours and was quite pleasant.
From Gudur Junction I took a rickshaw to the ashram. The ride was about 30 minutes long and surprisingly cheap.</p>
<h3 id="TTC"><a href="#TTC" class="headerlink" title="TTC"></a>TTC</h3><p>I was so happy to finally arrive at the ashram. The staff was very welcoming and helped me with my luggage. They immediately served me
tea and some snacks. I was shown to my room, where I was going to live for the next month together with my roommate.
I recommend arriving the day before the course starts, as it gives you time to adjust and get to know the place.  </p>
<h4 id="Accommodation"><a href="#Accommodation" class="headerlink" title="Accommodation"></a>Accommodation</h4><p>The place is magical. As it is surrounded by lush jungle, you’ll see lots of monkeys roaming around.</p>

<p>I stayed in a shared room, which was equipped with two beds, a fan, a table, a sink and a bathroom. The facilities
were pretty basic, but trust me, all you need will be there. The other options that I am aware of are private rooms and the shared dormitory.
There are pros and cons to each of them, but my train of thought was that I would have liked some privacy, but also wanted to meet new people,
so for me the shared room seemed like a good mixture of the two.
It was pretty cool to have our own shower and restroom, but the downside was that the single
and double rooms were closer to the road (which can be noisy), and further from the yoga halls. On the other hand, the
dormitory was right in the middle of the ashram. Honestly, I don’t think the double room was really worth it. If I were
to do it all over again, I would probably choose the dormitory. You’ll spend most of your time in the yoga halls anyway,
and by the end of the course, you’ll realize that it does not really matter where you are, because
“Happiness - ananda, bliss - is not outside, it is within”.</p>

<p>There are two main halls. Most of the asana classes were held in the Vishnu Hall, which offers a beautiful view of the jungle.
The other one, Mandakini Hall, is used for lectures and meditation. The ashram also has a reception, a small shop, and dining hall.</p>

<h4 id="Schedule-1"><a href="#Schedule-1" class="headerlink" title="Schedule"></a>Schedule</h4><p>The schedule was pretty intense. I would usually wake up at 5:15 AM, and the first class would start at 6:00 AM. Although
I don’t recommend it, I generally went to sleep way past 10:00 PM. I was just too excited to sleep.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apetenchea/cdroot/master/source/_posts/sivananda-yoga-teachers-training-course/media/schedule.jpg" alt="Schedule"></p>
<p>The first asana class was more focused on the teaching aspect of yoga, and the second one was more about the practice. The lectures
were very interesting. We learned about the history of yoga, the philosophy behind it, the Bhagavad Gita
and the anatomy of the human body. We would do lots of chanting and meditation. And believe it or not, we also had homework.
Nothing too difficult, but I am still surprised that we all managed to somehow make room for that in our schedule.
I found Vishnu Hall to be the most beautiful place in the ashram. It was so peaceful and quiet. I would often go there
to study.</p>

<p>Once or twice a week we would do walking meditation. We would walk around a nearby lake, then sit down, meditate and chant. </p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apetenchea/cdroot/master/source/_posts/sivananda-yoga-teachers-training-course/media/lake-mediation.jpg" alt="lake"></p>
<p>My favourite part was the chanting. It was so powerful. I sometimes felt like I was in a trance. Overall, I don’t remember
being so sober and ecstatic ever in my life. It is like that immense energy we all had as children, for example when we
used to play a football game with our friends. Imagine something like that, but with literally zero worries in the world,
as a grown adult, dependent on no one but yourself. It is just pure excitement and joy. Here’s a note I wrote to myself one
night during the course:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s like I am an adolescent again. Back then, I had such a tremendous amount of energy, yet my biggest wish was to
become independent. When I became independent, there were so many things I wanted to do, but I was lacking the energy.
Now, at this moment, I finally know how it feels to have both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We were all blessed to have Swami Janardhana Ananda by our side, as the philosophy teacher. Chanting and praying together with
him was a great experience. One evening, during <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGRhM77OSU0">Sri Lalitha Sahasranaamam</a>,
I had my deepest meditation ever. It was absolute bliss. After a while, the discomfort in my legs and butt started to
appear, but the bliss was so intense that it completely overshadowed it. Afterwards, I felt so rested and energized as
if I had a 12h sleep. I’ll post below a couple of snippets from our mantra recitation and chanting sessions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Om</strong>, the universal vibration. It is said that in the beginning, the universe there was in complete stillness.
Then, the creation process started with one vibration, and that is the sound of <em>Om</em>, which set everything in motion.
Think of it as the sound of the big-bang, from the perspective of the ancient yogis.<br><audio src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apetenchea/cdroot/master/source/_posts/sivananda-yoga-teachers-training-course/media/Om.mp3" controls></audio></li>
<li><strong>Om Namo Narayanaya</strong> is a mantra that is said to bring peace and tranquility. It is a salutation to Lord Vishnu. During
the course, we used to chant this a lot, as a contribution to world peace.<br><audio src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apetenchea/cdroot/master/source/_posts/sivananda-yoga-teachers-training-course/media/Om-Namo-Narayanaya.mp3" controls></audio></li>
<li><strong>Om Aim Hreem Kleem Chamundaye Viche</strong> is a mantra dedicated to Chandika, the divine mother. She is worshiped in order
to awaken the energy within us and in order to get rid of all the difficulties in life, bringing prosperity, wealth
and health. You can pray for yourself, or relatives and friends, whoever you want to, keeping them in mind while
reciting the mantra. In this recording we add “Namah” to it as a form of reverence.<br><audio src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apetenchea/cdroot/master/source/_posts/sivananda-yoga-teachers-training-course/media/Om-Aim-Hreem-Kleem-Chamundaye-Viche.mp3" controls></audio></li>
</ul>
<p>As for chanting Bhajans, the way we do it is call and response. The leader sings a line, and the group repeats it. It’s a
great way to get everybody involved. Here’s a recording of “Om Sakthi Om” that I sang with my friends. At first, I was
skeptical about it, but it turned out to be one of the most fun things we practiced during the course. It can be amazing
when you really put your heart into it. At the end of each song, everybody would go clapping and cheering out of genuine
excitement.<br><audio src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apetenchea/cdroot/master/source/_posts/sivananda-yoga-teachers-training-course/media/Om-Sakthi-Bhajan.m4a" controls></audio></p>
<p>Karma Yoga was also a part of the course. We would help with cleaning, cooking, and gardening. For the first two weeks,
I was assigned to the temple cleaning team. It was a great experience, and I got to meet some really lovely people. The
local priest, Muni Ji, was full of stories and always had a smile on his face. They often say that a keen sense of humor
is a key to keeping one’s ego in check. The capacity to step back and share a hearty laugh, regardless of the topic,
is truly admirable. In this respect, Muni Ji is a natural <span>&#x1F64F;</span>  </p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apetenchea/cdroot/master/source/_posts/sivananda-yoga-teachers-training-course/media/muni-ji.jpg" alt="Muni Ji"></p>
<p>The other two weeks, I spent cleaning the dormitory. It was a bit more challenging, and at first the environment did not seem as
fun as in the temple. The dormitory is a bit darker, which clearly helps at night, but during the day it can be
depressing. Nevertheless, the point of Karma Yoga is to help you get rid of your ego and free your mind. You learn
to do things without expecting anything in return. It’s a great way to practice selflessness and humility. In the end,
I realized that cleaning the dormitory is a great opportunity to practice. Think about it as “Advanced Karma Yoga”, and
be thankful for the opportunity to practice it. I can tell you that it changed something in me. By the end of the course,
I was so grateful that I would go during the evening and voluntarily clean the dining hall. It was an awesome feeling.</p>
<p>We also had plenty of fun and social activities together. Every Friday was a day off, and the ashram would organize
a trip to a nearby temple or a beach. Every week there was a talent show, which you don’t want to miss. One Friday, me and
some friends prepared dinner for the entire ashram. Cooking for 50 people was fun.</p>

<h4 id="Food"><a href="#Food" class="headerlink" title="Food"></a>Food</h4><p>The food follows the Sattvic diet, which is a pure vegetarian diet that is meant to promote a peaceful mind and long life.
There are two meals a day, brunch and dinner. The food is simple, not too spicy, and based on rice, lentils, vegetables.
Some small snacks and tea were served in the morning and afternoon.<br>I’m not going to lie, I was hungry, and it took me a while to get used to the food. The good part is that you may have
as many refills as you want, there’s no standard portion. Just make sure you don’t waste any food. It’s a good practice
to aim for about 50% of you stomach capacity, leaving 25% for water and the other 25% for air. <strong>I think it’s also worth
mentioning that I never felt sick or had any stomach issues from the ashram food.</strong></p>

If there’s one thing I am most grateful for, it is for my fellow yogis. Everybody was so upbeat, kind, friendly and supportive,
we really became one big family, in the true sense of the word. I’m getting emotional just thinking about it. I miss them so much,
and I’ll hope we’ll see each other again. I really don’t know what else to write, the feeling of being surrounded by such
wonderful people is just indescribable. You’ll have to go through TTC yourself to understand it. I’ll post a picture of us below.

<p>There were people from all walks of life. Some of us were in their 20’s, some in their 40’s and some in their 60’s. We had
different backgrounds, different cultures, different religions, different languages, but we all had one thing in common:
we were open-minded. Shout-out to my roommate, Venkat, a top chemistry researcher from Connecticut, United States,
who came to the ashram in order to dedicate more time to his spiritual practice, as he was doing TTC with us.
He was a great guy, and we had lots of interesting conversations together about the Bhagavad Gita, understanding Sanskrit,
and life in general.</p>

<h4 id="Graduation"><a href="#Graduation" class="headerlink" title="Graduation"></a>Graduation</h4><p>All the activities and classes are counted up for in order to get a certificate, and they’re pretty serious when it comes
to attendance. The final exam consists of a series of questions about the philosophy of yoga, the asanas, and the
anatomy of the human body. They give you about 3 hours to complete it, but it should be doable in about 2 hours.
If you’ve been paying attention during the lectures, you should be fine without any additional studying.
Please don’t stress about it, it’s not that difficult. They’re not trying to trick you, they just want to make
sure you’ve laid a good foundation for your future practice. Don’t worry, I promise you’ll pass <span>&#x1F609;</span><br>Below is a picture of me and Swami Janardhana Ananda, after the graduation ceremony.</p>

<h3 id="Departure"><a href="#Departure" class="headerlink" title="Departure"></a>Departure</h3><p>I left the ashram on 14<sup>th</sup> January 2024. It was a very beautiful morning, quite foggy. Those who remained had
our last walking meditation at the nearby lake, which was very blissful. I felt so grateful for the experience, there
was no room for sadness. I took the train back to Chennai, where I met some of my friends again, as we were all
going to the airport. I was very happy to spend some more time with a group of fellow ashram yogis from Iran,
whose flight was at a similar time. That departure was indeed hard, I can tell you that. I was the last to arrive at the
boarding gate.  </p>

<h2 id="After"><a href="#After" class="headerlink" title="After"></a>After</h2><blockquote>
<p>Has this course impacted me in a profound way?<br>Absolutely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It took me a while to fully recover. I lost some weight, I was feeling quite hungry. I was also a bit sad,
as I missed my friends from the ashram. But nevertheless, I immediately applied to become a yoga teacher (part-time).
The course focused a lot on the importance of teaching, and they really made us feel confident in our ability to do so.
For sure, you are not going to become a yoga master in only one month, but you’ll have a good foundation to build upon.
Any chance to polish your teaching skills is great.<br>I led my first yoga class on the 12th of February 2024, at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dpointstudio.ro/">D’Point Studio</a>.
I can tell you that, with every class, it gets better and better.
So my advice is, if you’re thinking about it, just go for it. You’ll be fine.</p>
